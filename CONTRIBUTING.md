## **0.** Preamble

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the G2Project-modules project by Dayo Akanji ("We" or "Us").

Software is deeply embedded in all aspects of our lives and it is important that it empowers, rather than restrict us. Free Software gives rights to use, understand, adapt and share software to everybody. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.

The development of Free Software can follow many patterns. In some cases, development is handled by a single programmer or a small group of people. Usually however, the creation and maintenance of software is a complex process that requires the contribution of many individuals. This also affects ownership of the rights to the software. In the latter case, rights in software are owned jointly by a large number of individuals and the resulting fragmentation of ownership rights can impose restrictions in the use, understanding, adaptation and sharing of software.

To tackle this issue, some projects require a full copyright assignment to be signed by all contributors. The problem with such assignments however, is that they often lack checks and balances that would protect the contributors from potential abuse of power from the new copyright holder.

The Fiduciary License Agreement was created by the Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. to concentrate all deciding power within one entity to avoid the fragmentation of rights on one hand, while preventing that single entity from abusing its power on the other. It does this by ensuring that software covered under the Fiduciary License Agreement will forever remain Free Software.

This process only serves for the transfer of economic rights. So-called moral rights (e.g. authors rights to be identified as authors) remain with the original authors and are inalienable.

The purpose of this Contributor License Agreement ("**Agreement**") is to clarify and document the rights granted by contributors to Us.

## **1.** Definitions

**You** means the entity that is making this Agreement with Us.

**Contribution** means any original work of authorship, including any original modifications or additions to an existing work of authorship, Submitted by You to Us.

**Copyright** means all rights protecting works of authorship, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence.

**Material** means the software or documentation made available by Us to third parties.

**Submit** means any act by which a Contribution is transferred to Us by You by means of tangible or intangible media, including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us, but excluding any transfer that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution." After You Submit the Contribution, it may be included in the Material.

**Documentation** means any non-software portion of a Contribution.

## **2.** License Grant

### **2.1** Copyright License to Us

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us a worldwide, royalty-free, exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable (except as stated in Section 8.2) license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including, but not limited to: 

* publish the Contribution,
* modify the Contribution,
* prepare derivative works based upon or containing the Contribution and/or to combine the Contribution with other Materials,
* reproduce the Contribution in original or modified form,
* distribute, to make the Contribution available to the public, display and publicly perform the Contribution in original or modified form.

### **2.2** Moral Rights

Moral Rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognized and cannot be waived by applicable laws. 

Notwithstanding, You may add your name to the attribution mechanism customary used in the Materials you Contribute to, such as the header of the source code files of Your Contribution, and We will respect this attribution when using Your Contribution.

### **2.3** Copyright License Back to You

Upon such grant of rights to Us, We immediately grant to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including, but not limited to:

* publish the Contribution,
* modify the Contribution,
* prepare derivative works based upon or containing the Contribution and/or to combine the Contribution with other Materials,
* reproduce the Contribution in original or modified form,
* distribute, to make the Contribution available to the public, display and publicly perform the Contribution in original or modified form.

This license back is limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the Material.

## **3.** Patents

### **3.1** Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of Materials distributed by Us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable (except as stated in Section 3.2) patent license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with any Material (and portions of such combination). 

This license applies to all patents owned or controlled by You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring of Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with any Material.

### **2.1** Revocation of Patent License

You reserve the right to revoke the patent license stated in Section 3.1 if We make any infringement claim that is targeted at your Contribution and not asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims of the Patents shall be considered for a "Defensive Purpose" if the claims are asserted against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Us or any of Our licensees.

## **4.** License Obligations by Us 

We agree to (sub)license the Contribution or any Materials containing, based on or derived from your Contribution under the terms of any licenses the Free Software Foundation classifies as Free Software License and which are approved by the Open Source Initiative as Open Source licenses.

More specifically and in strict accordance with the above paragraph, we agree to (sub)license the Contribution or any Materials containing, based on or derived from the Contribution only under the terms of Version 2 or future versions of the General Public License.

We agree to license patents owned or controlled by You only to the extent necessary to (sub)license Your Contributions and the combination of Your Contributions with the Material under the terms of any licenses the Free Software Foundation classifies as Free Software licenses and which are approved by the Open Source Initiative as Open Source licenses..

## **5.** Disclaimer

THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR YOU BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

## **7.** Approximation of Disclaimer and Damage Waiver

IF THE DISCLAIMER AND DAMAGE WAIVER MENTIONED IN SECTIONS 5 AND 6 CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS, REVIEWING COURTS SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAWS THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL CIVIL OR CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.
